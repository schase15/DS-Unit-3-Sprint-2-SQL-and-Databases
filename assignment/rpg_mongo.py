# Set table to variable name

# NOW YOU HAVE THE DATA STORED AS A DF

# Convert the DF to a dictionary to insert into Mongo

# Insert dictionary into Mongo
collection.insert_many(records)

# Check to make sure they were inserted
# Count the number of documents (rows) - should be 174

#### WRITTEN QUESTION ####

'''
I found working with MongoDB to be very similar to working with PostgreSQL. Things might be
named differently and queries are asked in different ways but a lot of the concepts are the same.
I like that PostgreSQL is more rigid and structured. It helps prevent errors from not
being careful when inputing values. It doesn't allow duplicate entries and makes sure schema is enforced.
It is also easier to create queries because you are using intuitive words like Select, where, is in etc...
However, it requires learning SQL which is a seperate skill.

I found MongoDB a little easier because it is using python. The syntax of the queries makes more sense 
than writting out a SQL, even though SQL is easier to interpret. I also felt more comfortable
manipulating the results of a query because it was stored in a list instead of an object. It is looser so 
seems quicker to get working. Mongo seems quicker to implement but feels like less of a polished product. 

You might choose one or the other based on the team skills, what previous db's you are using. It is much easier
to stick with the same database type instead of converting between the two.
